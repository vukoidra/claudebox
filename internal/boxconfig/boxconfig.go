// Package boxconfig owns the box's policy file: the roles a key may hold, and
// the slash commands that exist.
//
// Two sections, because there are two questions — what a caller's sessions may
// touch, and which commands they may run. It is a package rather than a file
// inside internal/api because two binaries need the same bytes: cbx reads it
// to decide what a request may do, and cbx-setuptool ships the default.
//
// Keys are not here. They live in the session database, because the API
// rewrites this file — that is what PUT /commands is — and a credential the
// caller can edit is not a constraint on that caller.
